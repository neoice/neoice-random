# 2007-12-13-alarm.sh
in 2007, I had 2 beige PCs stacked next to my bed. I used this script as an
alarm clock. originally, I used system beeps (\a) but then I discovered that
`/dev/urandom` would make the system speaker just go crazy, producing a vile
combination of beeps and scratches. I never slept through that.
