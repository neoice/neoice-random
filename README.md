this is a repo full of random scripts, half-baked projects and the occasional
school assignment. it exists for educational and historical purposes only. I
would recommend that you never attempt to use any of this code directly. parts
of it will be redacted, resulting in non-functional or mis-functioning code.

however, if you are interested in learning, you will find this repo ripe with
real life code from someone who was learning along the way. I may attempt to
organize things by date and possibly by language.
